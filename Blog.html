                using relative size to make an element responvise
            </p>
            <article>
                <p>
                    It matters to use relative units if we need to create a flexible and scalable design. 
                    We can make our design fit as the size of the screen changes by easily adjusting its size 
                    relative to the root. One can get easily confused on how to make the adjustment and the calculation 
                    even about which unit to use. In this case, it is necessary to pay attention to which element the calculation 
                    refers to correspondingly. In the specification the relative length units are defined as em, ex, ch and rem. 
                    These are font-relative length measurements. The specification also are defined by % value, which  is always 
                    relative to another value. Using relative values means that things can scale up and down in respective manner 
                    to the change of the other value.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Browsers having a zooming feature is also an easy option in which they take the control away from developers in terms 
                    of creating their own layout. Users can go to setting and change both the font-size and increase or decrease the zooming 
                    of the page. But as users keep changing the font-size and zooming, they might not get the desired output if the webpage is 
                    completely dependent on the zooming features of the browser. The webpage can be subjected to blurred vision. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    To Conclude the argument using relative units to specify element size  can reduce the blur vision create when zooming 
                    in too much and make reading in zoomed in state less irritating for the eye. 
                </p>

            <article>
                <p>
                    200px in rem equals to 12.5, And the computer interpreter definition of 1rem unit is equal to the computed value 
                    of font-size on the root element. When specified on the font-size property of the root element, the rem units 
                    refer to the property’s initial value. This means that 1rem equals the font size of the html element. When user 
                    sets different font-size on browser, rem automatically scale up or scale down elements like fonts, images etc on the 
                    webpage which is not the case with px.

                CSS3 new features
            </p>
            <article>
                <P>
                    Cascading Style Sheets Level 3 (CSS3) is the iteration of the CSS standard used in the styling and formatting of Web Pages. 
                    CSS3 incorporates the CSS2 with some changes and improvements
                </P>
                <p class="ti">
                    CSS3 Backgrounds
                </p>
                <P>
                    CSS3 provides several new properties to manipulate the background of an element like background clipping, 
                    multiple backgrounds, and the option to adjust the background size. these feature include: <br>
                    &bullet; Background-size property allows to change the size of the background images without changing the actual size of the image. <br>
                    &bullet; Background-clip property allows to change whether an element’s background extends into the border or not. <br>
	                &bullet; Background-origin property allows to change the positioning area of the background images. <br>
                    &bullet; Multiple Backgrounds allows to add more than one backgrounds to a single element by layering them on the top of one another. 
                    The backgrounds are given separated by commas and the first background given is placed on top and last background given is placed in the bottom.
                </P>
                <p class="ti">
                    Text Overflow
                </p>
                <p>
                    It allows to determine how texts that overflow their container should be applied displayed. It has values like nowarp, word-wrap, normal, and break-word
                </p>
                <p class="ti">
                    New Colors
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before CSS3 color can be only determined by “color keywords” and RGB notations. In addition to that CSS3 adds some new notations for setting color values for the elements. <br>
                    &bullet; RGBA color values (red-green-blue-alpha)- is an extension of RGB color model with alpha channel which specifies the degree of transparency of a color. <br>
                    &bullet; HSL color values- Hue-Saturation-Lightness functional notation is color value setting function that take three parameters. The first parameter is Hue that 
                    represent an angle of the color wheel ranging from 0 to 360. The second parameter is saturation which control the shade of color from 0% to 100%. The third parameter 
                    is lightness controlling light intensity ranging from 0% to 100%.  <br>
                    &bullet; HSLA color values - Hue-Saturation-Lightness-Alpha is an extension HSL color notation with alpha channel.
                </p>
                <p class="ti">
                    Media Queries
                </p>
                <p>
                    IT allow to customize the presentation of web pages for a specific range of devices like mobile phones, table, desktops without any change in markups. 
                    It consists of a media type and zero or more expressions that match the type and conditions of a particular media features such as device width or 
                    screen resolution.
                </p>
                <p class="ti">
                    Flexible box (flexbox)
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is a new layout model for creating the flexible user interface design with multiple rows and columns without 
                    using the percentage or fixed length values. It provides a simple and powerful methods for controlling the distributing
                     of space and alignment of content automatically through stylesheet without interfering the actual markup.
                </p>
                <p class="ti">
                    Borders
                </p>
                <p>
                    CSS3 introduced two new border properties for styling the borders of an elements, border-image property used for adding
                     an image to borders and border-radius property for making the rounded corners without using any images.
                </p>
                <p class="ti">
                    Gradient
                </p>
                <p>
                    This property provides a flexible solution to generate smooth transitions between different colors. It also helps to reduce
                     the download times and saves the internet data usage, reduce quality lose when scaling up and down, and makes render faster.
                </p>

                    Advanced Selectors
                </p>
                <p>
                    CSS3 selectors can identify elements based on its attributes, the position in which they appear in the parent element, and the state. <br>
                    &bullet; Attributes Selectors allow to apply one determined formatting to certain elements based on the value of one attribute. <br>
                    &bullet; Position Selectors work based on the position of the element in the document or in the container (parent element). <br>
                    &bullet; State Selectors work based on the actual state of the control (empty, enabled, disabled , etc.).

                    Calculating Values
                </p>
                <p>
                    It allows to calculate values of the elements using the “calc()” function, it does simple arithmetic calculations such as size, frequency, and angle.
                </p>
                <p class="ti">
                    Drop Shadow
                </p>
                <p>
                    This property removed the method of creating the shadows by using sliced images, but Drop shadow allows to add or remove shadow effects to the 
                    elements without using any images. Using text-shadow and box-shadow property allows to add shadow effects surrounding text and box elements respectively.
